			<h2>
				What Is Gambling Addiction?
			</h2>
			<p>
				Gambling addiction, is more than just betting for fun. It’s a compulsive behavior where the urge to gamble starts interfering with your daily life, your finances, your relationships, and your mental health. And for many students, this starts online, often without them even realizing it.
			</p>
			<h2>Why Is This Happening to So Many Students?</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Targeted Ads & Social Media Algorithms:</b> Platforms like TikTok and Instagram show more gambling-related content the more you engage with it — tutorials, “big win” clips, influencer promos, and direct links to betting sites.</li>
				<li><b>College Demographics Are High-Risk:</b> Males aged 18–22, especially undergrads, are statistically the most likely to engage in online gambling — and most don’t realize how quickly things can spiral.</li>
				<li><b>It Feels Harmless at First:</b> Sports betting, casino-style apps, and simulated games all seem like entertainment. But they’re designed with psychological triggers — fast results, flashy rewards, and the illusion of control — that mimic addictive behavior.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>
				Warning Signs to Watch For:
			</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Gambling more often or with more money than you can afford</li>
				<li>Chasing losses or lying about your gambling</li>
				<li>Feeling anxious, depressed, or irritable when trying to stop</li>
				<li>Using gambling as an escape from stress, loneliness, or boredom</li>
				<li>Late-night betting after long hours on social media</li>
				<li>Financial problems or hiding spending from others</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>
				Why It’s So Easy to Fall Into
			</h2>
			<p>
				Social media platforms are designed to keep your attention — and gambling sites use the same tactics. The instant gratification of betting feels a lot like the dopamine hit of a “like” or a viral video. Over time, your brain starts craving the rush — even when it’s hurting you.
			</p>
			<h2>
				What You Can Do:
			</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Track your habits:</b> Awareness is the first step</li>
				<li><b>Set time and money limits:</b> And stick to them</li>
				<li><b>Avoid gambling-related content:</b> Especially on social media</li>
				<li><b>Talk to someone:</b> You're not weak — you're human</li>
				<li><b>Find healthier ways to cope:</b> Exercise, hobbies, or just stepping away from screens</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>
				Support Resources:
			</h2>

				<li>Miami University Counseling Center</li>
				<li>National Problem Gambling Helpline: 1-800-GAMBLER</li>
