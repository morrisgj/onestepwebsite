            <h2>A message from Garrett Morris, creator of Miami Addiction Hotline</h2>
            <p>
                Hey — I’m Garrett Morris, a student at Miami University, and the person behind this website.
                This project comes from a personal place. I created this space for students who are struggling with gambling and social media addiction because I’ve been there too.
            </p>

            <p>
                I started noticing a problem when it started affecting my life outside of my home — it started affecting the way I would interact with other people in my life. I grew to be a burden, I grew to be an annoyance, and I grew to be someone I didn't even like to have around.
                This is where I knew that I had to do something. I spoke up and asked for help; I reached out to friends and family. I used my resources. This is where my website comes to life. Based on my own experience, I can get a grasp on what people need in times of struggle, like I was struggling.
                With this website, I hope to help many other students find help and better their own lives.
            </p> 

            <p>
                College can be one of the best times of your life — but it’s also a time when a lot of us face stress, isolation, and pressure to keep up. Sometimes, we turn to things like gambling, social media, and drinking to cope, to escape, or just to feel something. But when those things start to control
                you instead of the other way around, it’s time for a change.
            </p>

            <p>
                This site exists to help make that change feel possible.
            </p>

				  <h3>Understanding Addiction: More Than Just a Choice</h3>
				  <p>Addiction is a complex brain disorder characterized by compulsive engagement in rewarding stimuli despite adverse consequences. It affects millions of college students nationwide, yet many suffer in silence due to stigma and misunderstanding.</p>
				  
				  <h4>Key Facts About Addiction:</h4>
				  <ul>
					<li><b>Brain Changes:</b> Addiction physically alters brain structure and function, particularly in areas involved with reward, stress, and self-control.</li>
					<li><b>It's Not Just Substances:</b> Behavioral addictions (gambling, social media, gaming) activate the same neural pathways as substance addiction.</li>
					<li><b>College Students at Risk:</b> 1 in 3 college students report behaviors consistent with at least one addiction during their academic career.</li>
					<li><b>Dual Diagnosis:</b> Addiction often co-occurs with mental health conditions like anxiety, depression, or ADHD.</li>
				  </ul>
				  
				  <h4>Warning Signs to Watch For:</h4>
				  <ul>
					<li>Spending increasing amounts of time engaged in the behavior</li>
					<li>Failed attempts to cut down or control the behavior</li>
					<li>Neglecting responsibilities, relationships, or activities you once enjoyed</li>
					<li>Continuing despite negative consequences to your health, finances, or relationships</li>
					<li>Experiencing withdrawal symptoms when unable to engage in the behavior</li>
				  </ul>
				  
				  <h4>Recovery is Possible</h4>
				  <p>Recovery is a journey, not a destination. With the right support and resources, people overcome addictions every day. The first step is recognizing there's a problem and reaching out for help.</p>
				  
				  <p>At Miami Addiction Hotline, we believe in meeting you where you are, without judgment. Whether you're looking for information, support groups, or treatment options, we're here to help you find your path forward.</p>

            <p>
                This isn’t about perfection — it’s about progress. I’m not a therapist or expert, but I am someone who gets it. And if I can start turning things around, I know you can too.
            </p>

            <p>Thanks for being here. You’re taking a step forward just by reading this.</p>
